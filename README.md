# college_degree_gender_gaps
An analysis of NCES data on gender representation in various college degrees

This is a Dataquest.io project for the "Storytelling Through Data Visualization" course. Working in higher ed. at the present, I found the patterns fascinating and even the classifications of categories. Universities vary in their definitions of what constitutes broad fields such as "social sciences". My own institution, SWU, presently classifies psychology as a social science, but the pattern of women/men majors in that field is more consisten with health professions, for example. This is some food for thought as SWU is starting a MS in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and looking to potentially reorganize my college's structure!

This project also nicely reviews and applies Edward Tufte's principles from his seminal works like #The Visial Display of Quantitative Information#. I read this book while in graduate school and absolutely loved it--everything down to the quality craftsmanship of the book itself. I am so happy that the Dataquest curriculum has emphasizes things like Tufte's work and Markdown while teaching data science. These are tools I use daily and it's exciting to be able to incoporate them into code using the powerful features of Jupyter Notebooks. Thank you, Dataquest and Jupyter!

Enjoy,
